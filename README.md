# Project-4b
## Ian Woodcock
### Things I liked about prolog
- fairly simple
- good amount of rescources to help (especially after io)
- some useful built in predicates
- not so much the language itself, but I thought the projects in this part were fun

### Things I didnt like
- syntax was a bit odd
- navigating the documentation took me a while
- I really dont like how the capitalization of variable names matters, its a dumb complain but it threw me off multipul times

### biggest rescource
- the official documentation https://www.swi-prolog.org/
